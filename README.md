🚀 Excited to share my latest project: a Hand Gesture Volume Controller using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe! 🤚🎶

This innovative project leverages real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition to adjust system volume seamlessly. By detecting the distance between the thumb and index finger, the volume can be controlled intuitively and contactlessly.

Key Features:
🔹Real-time Hand Tracking: Utilizing MediaPipe’s robust hand detection and tracking capabilities.
🔹Gesture-Based Volume Control: Adjust the volume by simply moving your fingers – an efficient and touch-free solution.
🔹Volume Visualization: A dynamic volume bar displayed on the screen for real-time feedback.
🔹Smooth Performance: Ensuring high FPS for a seamless user experience.

Technical Highlights:
💻 *Python*: The backbone of this project, integrating various libraries.
📸 *OpenCV*: Handling video capture and processing.
🖐 *MediaPipe*: Providing accurate hand landmarks detection.

How It Works:
1. Hand Detection: The camera captures the hand movements.
2. Landmark Extraction: MediaPipe identifies key landmarks on the hand.
3. Distance Calculation: The distance between thumb and index finger is computed.
4. Volume Adjustment: The volume is adjusted based on the computed distance.
